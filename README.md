## Project Disclaimer & Heritage

**BoredOS** is the successor to **[BrewKernel](https://github.com/boreddevnl/brewkernel)**, a project initiated in 2023. 

While BrewKernel served as the foundational learning ground for this OS, it has been officially **deprecated and archived**. It no longer receives updates, bug fixes, or pull request reviews. BoredOS represents a complete architectural reboot, applying years of lessons learned to create a cleaner, more modular, and more capable system.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Please ensure all issues, discussions, and contributions are directed to this repository. Legacy BrewKernel code is preserved for historical purposes only and is not compatible with BoredOS.
